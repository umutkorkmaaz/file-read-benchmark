# File Read Benchmark
For R&D purposes, the time to find the last line of data in a CSV file of 625,330 lines (~27.8mb) in C, C++, Go, NodeJS, PHP, Python and Ruby was calculated in milliseconds.

> Note: The original code fragment was written in PHP and translated to other languages using Stack Overflow and ChatGPT. I am aware that results may vary with different algorithms so if you have ideas for any language, please feel free to share them.
